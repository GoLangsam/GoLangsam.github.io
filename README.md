## History

Late summer 2016 I started to become a `\_O_/` when a friend introduced me to [go](https://golang.org)

At first I studied [*The Go Programming Language*](http://www.gopl.io/) by *Alan A.A. Donovan* and *Brian Kernighan*.
Having seen a few other writings, I still consider it ***the*** book about the language and am thankful to my friend, who gave it to me.

So I played around at first with some simple tools and familiarised myself with idioms and work flow.
One such tool helped me to generate plenty of textfiles I needed from some simple data structures.
Just: these structures were anything but stable - and it became anoying to me to always have to change code a little, and rebuild.
Thus: The idea / vision of an agnostic generator was born - but left dormant for a while.

Then I chose a more ambitious challange: `dlx` - a fresh look at an old, fast and underrated backtracking algorithm
(to be published and commented upon another day).

Early spring 2016 I got more interested in **concurrency**.
The famous slides [Concurrency is not parallelism](http://blog.golang.org/concurrency-is-not-parallelism) made me see interesting patterns.
Just: for sake of teaching, they were kept to a minimal coding - which sacrificed quality.
And they worked with `int` only, not with 'my favourite type'.

Thus: I started to make templates about piping with channels and spawned go routines,
and at the same time to build my agnostic generator `dotgo`.
Latter took longer than expected ;-)
Just: I did not want to compromise on some of my ambitious (and initially somewhat vague) ideas.

As of now, I am still busy to polish and publish the software,
and to enhance the functionalities given by the template generated code,
both in functional ways (e.g. adding Fan-In's and FanOut)
as well as in terms of what I call `flavours`,
which includes isomorph support of Suppy & Demand channels
as well as to support timeouts and/or cancels (e.g. using `context.Context`).

For the time being,
please find more details [here](https://github.com/GoLangsam/AnyType/blob/master/chan/ReadMe.md),
and templates as well as generated go source code [here](https://github.com/GoLangsam/AnyType/tree/master/chan)
